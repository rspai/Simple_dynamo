Simple Amazon Dynamo

This project was implemented as a part of Distributed Systems course curriculum at University at Buffalo.

* This project deals with the implementation of a simplified Dynamo with features such as partitioning, replication and failure handling.
* The goal is to ensure availability and linearizability. The implementation performs concurrent read and writes to the system even under failures.At the same time, reads return the most recent writes.
